Do you want to make cookies in the shape of an Aiboo, Michael, or
FeeBean? If you've got access to a 3D printer and some baking skills,
this one's for you!

## Printing 

These models are designed to be printed on an FDM printer with a 0.4mm
diameter nozzle. If you can get food grade PLA, that is very
recommended, otherwise undyed or natural PLA would be a good choice.

For finishing, I take a small knife and scrape off blebs and large
strings, then use a lighter flame to melt any of the small strings I
missed. The cutter parts tend to print with pretty minimal stringing
and blebbing, the stamp parts tend to need a little bit more love.

Before usage, and after you have gotten them dirty, I recommend
thoroughly cleaning the cookie cutters and stamps with a bowl of soapy
water, and a small brush like a toothbrush to get into the small nooks
and crannies.

# Cookies

## Recipes

In order to get good results, you need to choose a cookie recipe that
is intended for cut out or ideally stamped cookies. **Do not use a
drop cookie recipe (such as chocolate chip) or storebought ready to
bake cookie dough. It will melt into a puddle and you will be sad.**

Some recipes that I have had good success with and would recommend are:

- [King Arthur Light Spice Holiday Cookies](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/light-spice-holiday-cookies-recipe)
- [King Arthur Two Tone Festive Sugar Cookies](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/two-tone-festive-sugar-cookies-recipe) - specifically the chocolate half of the recipe
- [My Mom's Gingerbread Cookie recipe](#moms-gingerbread-recipe) - see below. This is what I used for the cookies shown here.

The two King Arthur recipes are quite sensitive to what fat is
used. My recommendation is a 50/50 mixture of butter a stick
margarine, and a higher melting point fat such as lard or vegetable
shortening. 100% margarine or butter makes the dough quite difficult
to handle. When cold (and you want the dough cold), the dough is very
stiff and very difficult to roll out. As the dough warms up however,
it becomes very loose and very difficult to work with. Conversely,
100% vegetable shortening doesn't stiffen up much at all when chilled,
making it difficult to tweak dough firmness as you go.

## Baking

Chill the dough prior to baking. You will want to keep the dough cold,
as a firmer dough is easier to work with, especially when trying to
peel it off of a cookie stamp.

Preheat your oven to the recommended temperature, and roll out your
dough to roughly 1/4" thick with a rolling pin on a well floured
surface. Now it's time to cut!

Cutting out the cookies is relatively straightforward; you can add
some flour to the cutter if it's sticking badly, but I haven't had a
ton of issues with that. The real tricky part is the stamping. You
will want the stamp to have something on it to prevent sticking; flour
works, cooking spray or oil works better. Stamp the cookie dough
firmly and *very carefully* peel the cookie off of the stamp and place
onto a cookie sheet. If the cookie dough is being especially stubborn,
it may be worth trying to stamp the cookie dough first and then
cutting it with the cookie cutter. On a relatively forgiving sticky
dough I didn't find too much of a difference between the two, but a
stickier dough might prefer stamping prior to cutting

I've had a couple of batches where the stamping didn't come out
nicely, either because the cookie rose too much or because the cookie
melted before the dough started to set. For the first, rolling the
cookie dough thinner, or reducing the amount of leavening will
help. For the second, working the dough with some extra flour tends to
help, as does chilling the dough after it is cut and raising the oven
temperature.

### Mom's Gingerbread Cookie Recipe

Ingredients:

- 1/4 cup Crisco
- 1/2 cup White Sugar
- 1/2 cup Molasses
- 3 1/2 cup Flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2/3 cup milk (or water)

Procedure:

1. Cream the crisco, sugar, and molasses together. Use a mixer please if you have the option, doing it by hand is awful
2. Mix in the flour, baking soda, spices, and salt
3. Mix in the milk. You may need to add slightly more than this, the dough should hold together into a solid mass in the mixer, and be a bit sticky

Refrigerate for a couple hours or overnight

Bake at 350F for 8 minutes

The first batch didn't come out so good... These were made using my
mom's gingerbread recipe, but I altered it slightly due to running out
of molasses. Evidently that made the dough more likely to melt, like
these did. Subsequent batches I chilled in the freezer for about 10
minutes, and baked at a higher temperature of 400F.
