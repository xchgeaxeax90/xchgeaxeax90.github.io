I made this site to have a place to put vtuber related projects, writings, and other unserious works. If you're looking for professional info (projects, resume, etc.) you will not find them here, *turn back before it's too late.*

## Projects

[Light Up Wisp Nametag](https://github.com/xchgeaxeax90/wisp-nametag) - 
A custom made PCB in the shape of a nametag, with a flashing wisp on it. Build your own, if you dare!


## Other Stuff

[NFC Tag Customization](/nfc_setup) - 
Share your socials with just a tap! Customizing an NFC Tag to add a link to your discord/twitter/carrd for easy sharing at a convention.
